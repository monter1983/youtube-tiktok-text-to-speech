# youtube-tiktok-text-to-speech
Hi, meet the text-to-speech generator! Create short films for YouTube or TikTok. No character limit. Pay once, use always! You can use over 30 languages. In the later part of the video, you'll find a few voice samples. Make sure to watch until the end. See what I can do now! Let's get started.

Once you start me up, my operation is intuitive. In the title field, you enter the title under which I'll generate the film. In the text field, you type everything I should say after generating the film. In the language model field, you select the language in which I should speak, for example, now I'm speaking in English. In the media type field, you choose whether you want to generate a film from mp4 files or from images. In the scene duration field, you select how often the scene should change in the film. Scene, meaning the displayed image, changes every 10 seconds.
